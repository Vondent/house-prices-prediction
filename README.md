A Simple Data Science Project Using Python to apply Machine Learning techniques for the House Prices Predictions Competition on Kaggle.

Implements Regression Models such as:
- Linear Regresion
- Random Forest Regression
- XGB Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- LGBM Regression
- Voting Regression
- CatBoost Regression
- Stacking Regression

With the use of these regression models and 79 explanatory variables, I have applied Data Wrangling/Mutation to discover an accurate model which can predict the Final Sale Price of a House
